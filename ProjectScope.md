* What problem are we trying to solve? How did we decide this was a problem that needed solving?
   > A: In Rwanda, education and resources are limited, so Sheer Love Rwanda and this platform aim to improve these conditions for young children.
   To provide students with a place to use technology, engage in learning, and offer parents the necessary resources and information. This was determined
   to be a problem because of reports and tracking that detailed the staggering number of young children who either do not go to school or are unsuccessful with it.
* What does success look like for this project? What does failure look like?
   > A: We can define success vs failure by engagement and how it trends along with academics/grades. The goal is to make students want to learn and enjoy learning.
* Target Audience
  * Who is the intended user? How were they involved in the design process of this system?
     > A: The two users are the student and the teacher. It must be usable and provide all necessary features and capabilities to engage and be sufficient for both parties.
     We are also considering extending this to housing a third user, the parent.
  * Are there other beneficiaries/people this platform services?
     > A: Members of Sheer Love Rwanda, other than teachers, directly benefit from this app as well due to their engagement with parents.
* What challenges have come up?
  * Issues implementing certain features?
  * Issues with integrating this platform into where it is needed?
  * Usage confusion?
  * New problems? Has the plan/execution deviated at all?
   > A: It was halted due to a change in the education curriculum by the Rwanda government.
* How do you measure impact? What metrics matter most [for determining the value this platform provides]?
   > A: Engagement, changes in grades, participation trends
* Has this been deployed/tested by real users? Is there any feedback? Documentation?
   > A: There is some mock data/db for local  testing, so I do not believe it was ever deployed but was tested remotely by SLW
