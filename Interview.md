## Interview process

### Interview #1 - With Allan

The primary intention of this platform was to connect students with teachers. With changes in the education curriculum by the government of Rwanda, the project was basically halted/shut down. He went over the overarching details of the project scope and what happened. This initial interview was intended to discuss high-level details of this project, but we were routed to William for an interview to discuss those specifics.

### Interview #2 - With William -> Previous team lead on this project

We spoke with William, who built out the Android side of the application, which is the only interface for interaction. 

There are two main aspects of the platform for students, which include a math game and assignments. Assignments take on two types: MC or a verbally recorded response. On the teacher side, there is class/student management regarding grading and the creation of assignments. A bit of ambiguity here since this project appeared to be building out the platform itself, not implementing the curriculum, so uncertain as to how the shutdown was related to the curriculum change.

We weren't able to get many details from William, so we chose to meet with Allan again.

### Interview #3 - With Allan

We discussed potential improvements and features that could add value to this application with him. He provided feedback and dialogue from the perspective of a teacher who has experienced various learning platforms, etc. We also covered high-level details of the project, such as challenges and how this tool interacts with SLW.

Some initial areas for potential improvement involve more flexibility on assignments (the types of questions available [T/F, short answer, drawing, etc]). We came to the decision that the first feature to explore and implement involves an interactive tool (we chose drawing) to improve engagement with learning material for younger children. We also explored potentially expanding the platform with a parent portal to upload resources/connect teachers with parents, as it was stated that SLW provides various resources to students' parents as well. This can be thought of as a hub for SLW to route parents to when they could benefit from specific resources.
